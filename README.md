# R-SkyObjects_DecisionTree

The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) was a groundbreaking, two-decade-long astronomical project that meticulously collected data on the brightness, electromagnetic waves, and movement of celestial objects. This was achieved through the use of advanced telescopes, digital cameras, and spectrographs. 

All of this invaluable data is housed within the publicly accessible SDSS SkyServer database, freely available to both the scientific community and the general public. The SDSS has had a profound impact on our understanding of the universe, providing a wealth of astronomical information to researchers worldwide. 

This study focuses on these very data, aiming to classify celestial bodies - using decision tree - within the database into three categories: star, galaxy, or quasar. This classification will be based on the comprehensive information gathered during the SDSS's extensive sky observations.
